Programing Guidlines:
=========================================================================================================================================

1) TradingClient.php implements accessing the trading server. It provides all required function calls which are needed by your trading task. 
please refer to the file for more detailed description of each web service query.

2) please read through trading.main.php to understand all steps in product trading.

3) modify upon trading.strategy.sample.php to apply your own trading strategy.

IMPORTANT: 
1) RENAME trading.strategy.sample.php, e.g. my.trading.strategy.php to avoid overwriting.
	2) modify trading.main.php by changing "require_once "./trading.strategy.sample.php" to "require_once "./my.trading.strategy.php". This line is at the very begining of the file
	3) the data structure of the server response is explained when it shows up in the first time.
	4) there should be very minimum changes for trading.main.php. You are supposed to implement your business strategy in my.trading.strategy.php, namely, you should make changes to three functions, offer_strategy, referral_strategy, accept_offer_referral. Please avoid changing the function signatures (function name, arguments).
